class Weights:
    """
    This class is used to group important attributes associated with the pre-trained weights.
    Args:
        url (str): The location where we find the weights.
        transforms (Callable): A callable that constructs the preprocessing method (or validation preset transforms)
            needed to use the model. The reason we attach a constructor method rather than an already constructed
            object is because the specific object might have memory and thus we want to delay initialization until
            needed.
        meta (Dict[str, Any]): Stores meta-data related to the weights of the model and its configuration. These can be
            informative attributes (for example the number of parameters/flops, recipe link/methods used in training
            etc), configuration parameters (for example the `num_classes`) needed to construct the model or important
            meta-data (for example the `classes` of a classification model) needed to use the model.
